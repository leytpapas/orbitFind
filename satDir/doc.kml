<p>This KML network link visualizes all earth orbiting objects tracked by the <a href="http://www.stratcom.mil/">United States Strategic Command</a>
(USSTRATCOM) using the satellite database processed by <a href="http://www.agi.com/">Analytical Graphics, Inc.</a> using the
<a href="http://www.stk.com/products/components/main.cfm">Dynamic Geometry Library</a>.  All satellites are tracked in real-time
and updated every 30 seconds.</p>

<p> USSTRATCOM has been tracking space objects since 1957 when the Soviets opened the space age with the launch of Sputnik I.
Since then, they have recorded more than 26,000 space objects orbiting Earth.  There are currently more than 12,000 man-made
orbiting objects, the rest have re-entered Earth's turbulent atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted
the Earth. The space objects now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies
weighing under 10 pounds. About 3,000 space objects are operational satellites, the rest are space debris, retired satellites
and rocket bodies left over from launches.</p>

<p> Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI) develops commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) analysis software for land, sea, air and space that
is relied upon by the national security and space communities. With more than 32,000 worldwide installations, the main applications
of AGI technologies focus on battlespace management, geospatial intelligence, space systems and national defense programs. In addition
to the STK product suite, AGI produces the desktop software applications Navigation Tool Kit and Orbit Determination Tool Kit; interactive
visualization AGI Viewer software; and the embedded technology development tool 4DX. For more information about AGI or its commercially
available software technologies, e-mail <a href="mailto:info@agi.com">info@agi.com</a> or explore <a href="http://www.agi.com/">www.agi.com.</a></p>]]></description>
